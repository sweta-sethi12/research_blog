							Gravitational wave signal can be decomposed into the spherical harmonic multipoles which 

							consist of dominant and sub-dominant modes. The dominant, also known as the quadrupolar 
							mode and is represented as (l,|m|)=(2,2). However, it has been
							found that the contribution of the sub-dominant modes i.e. [(2,1), (3,3), (4,4)] modes
							 gives an accurate recovery
							of different intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of binary mergers. The waveform
							models describing the inspiral, merger, and ringdown (IMR) stages of compact
							binary mergers are now available for the non-spinning, aligned-spin, and precessing
							configuration. The paper compares the recovery of different parameters using IMRPhenomD, 
							which is a quadrupolar mode waveform with IMRPhenomHM, which is a computationally expensive 
							higher mode phenomenological waveform approximant.

                        <p>
							It was just after the detection of GW170729 (which had higher mass and non-zero spins), 
							which was a result of mergers of two unequal binaries, proposed the use of the higher 
							mode (or sub-dominant modes) waveform model to recover the parameters accurately. This
							 is the reason we use the IMRPhenomHM waveform which has an aligned-spin configuration along

							with higher modes. Contrary, the sub-dominant modes containing waveforms are the weakest for
							the equal-mass binaries.

                        <p>
							The gravitational wave signal is a 15-dimensional function and consists of 8 intrinsic
							 parameters (mass and spins of binaries) and the rest of the extrinsic parameters 
							 (luminosity distance, inclination angle, sky-location, geocent time, RA, DEC). For a 
							 given system as the binary inclination to the detector changes from face-on (theta= 0 degrees) 
							 to edge-on (theta= 90 degrees), the contribution of the dominant mode decreases, so the 
							 overall power of the signal and the importance of the sub-dominant mode increases. Parameters 
							 recovered by IMRPhenomHM are not only better constrained w.r.t IMRPhenomD, but they also 
							 break the inclination and luminosity distance degeneracy, which will be discussed further.

                        <p>
							In the recovery of the intrinsic parameters i.e. the black hole masses 
							(total mass of ,binaries, and mass ratio: defined as the ratio of primary/heavier BH to 
							secondary/lighter mass BH) and spin (chi-eff), they find that for the IMRPhenomHM injection 
							at the edge-on, the posteriors for M_{total} and q=4,8 are slightly biased for the lower 
							value. But the injection inclination of 60 degrees looks suitable for M_{total}, q=4,8, 
							and chi-eff, because at this angle the recovered inclination peaks to the true value. This
							waveform recovers non-biased chi-eff even at a higher inclination.

							(edge-on).</a>
						<p>
							In the recovery of the extrinsic parameters i.e. the inclination angle and the luminosity 
							distance, it is found that by using the dominant mode at a higher inclination, the distance 
							gets overestimated because the recovered inclination angle (theta_{JN}) has more support from 
							the non-edge-on inclination. Also, it shows a bimodal behavior. Even IMRPhenomHM shows 
							bi-modality due to the priors, but the posteriors are better constrained. Bi-modality is 
							due to the effects of the prior over the parameters and the inaccuracy of the waveform model 
							to create a true multi-mode signal. Thus a multi-mode template can contain the degeneracy 
							between the inclination angle, polarization, and phase, thus leading to an improved value 
							of inclination and better precession of luminosity distance.  For the IMRPhenomHM injection 
							inclination of 60 degrees and 90 degrees (edge-on), they see the recovered inclination peaks 
							at the true value. In comparison with hybrid Numerical Relativity (NR) injections, it can be 
							inferred that a larger systematics error will be observed in the edge-on system where the 
							higher modes contribute the most to the signals. To check the faithfulness of the IMRPhenomHM 
							model of recovering different posteriors, we look for its mismatches with the hybrid NR 
							waveform model.
