                        <p>
                            Searching Exoplanets has been a long quest and studying them has enabled 
                            us to perform statistical studies and answer key questions about the planet formation and 
                            their evolution. 51 Pegasi b was the first exoplanet discovered around the solar like stars. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Here we discuss about the various methods for the detection of the Exoplanets.
                            These methods includes: <strong>Radial velocity</strong> method which was used for the discovery of 51 Pegasi b.

                        <p>
                            The <strong>Transit method </strong>is helpful to know about the atmosphere and weather of an exoplanet, this is because
                             during transit the light from the host star will pass through the atmosphere of the exoplanet, thus revealing 
                             the molecular absorption in the exosphere. This was first carried out by Charbonneau et al. who detected 
                             sodium absorption features in the atmosphere of hot Jupiter HD 209458b. However, transit method is 
                             difficult for searching smaller exoplanets since they require very high photometric accuracy. 
                             Thus Kepler spacecraft, space based telescope is the key.

                        <p>
                            So to detect the low mass exoplanets we use another method called <strong> Gravitational microlensing</strong>, which
                            relies on gravitational lensing by the planet. Bohdan Paczynski was the first person to demonstrate
                            that microlensing is capable of detecting compact stellar objects associated with exoplanets. 
                            We can also directly detect the exoplanet through the <strong>Direct imaging</strong> method, which can help us 
                            distinguish between the photons of the exoplanet from that of the host star. It also helps us 
                            understand exoplanet formation and evolution with time. Most of the exoplanets discovered by 
                            this method are far away from the host star (large orbital distance), thus is a challenge to 
                            in situ planet formation mechanism.

                            exoplanets from radial velocity, transit,microlensing, and direct imaging methods. Data gathered from NASA Exoplanet Archive.</center> </a>
                        <p>
                            To get an idea about evolution of planets we need an accurate measurement of their mass and radii. 
                            The radial velocity method gives a precise mass and radius estimate, which can further provide us 
                            insights about the mass-radius relation. This results in finding of the density, structure and the
                            gas envelope present in the exoplanet and to get atmospheric details we use the transit method. 
                        </p>	
                        <p>
                            So we infer that planet formation depends on the mass-radius relation and the orbital distance. 
                            One of the process includes <strong>core accretion</strong>, where small particles collide, coagulate and accrete 
                            gases from surrounding to form Jovian planets. It results in planet which are metallicity 
                            dependent (elements other than H and He). In <strong>disk instability</strong> planet formation process, the 
                            protoplanetary disk becomes cool and dense and thus unstable to gravitational collapse and 
                            form gaseous planets. This process has got no metallicity. <strong>Planetary scattering</strong> and 
                            <strong>cloud fragmentation</strong> processes takes place when the planets are formed at larger orbital distance 
                            or far away from the host stars. It has been found that most exoplanets have been formed by the 
                            core accretion method.
